TODO:
- Make comments on individual wordclouds (half done)
- Add the correct Explainer notebook link on the website
- Explanation of text part in explainer notebook

Consider:
-  When you plot a logarithmic axis there is no need to write “Logarithmic X”. You can simply say “X”. On the y-axis, if you have a density you can simply say “Probability density” rather than “logarithmic density of X”. The density is a density no matter how you bin. 
(fixed)
- You computed the degree assortativity using the pre-implemented networkx function. Skal vi implementere noget selv?¨
- Skal man kun arbejde med largest connected component?

If overskud: 
- Add more technical and descriptive markdown sections in the notebook.
