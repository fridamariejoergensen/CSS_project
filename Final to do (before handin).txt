TODO:

- Write conlusion on entire project
- Add data "download option" to the website as mentioned in the criteria
- Make comments on individual wordclouds
- Add the correct Explainer notebook link on the website 
- Add images of networks in explainer notebook

Consider:
-  When you plot a logarithmic axis there is no need to write “Logarithmic X”. You can simply say “X”. On the y-axis, if you have a density you can simply say “Probability density” rather than “logarithmic density of X”. The density is a density no matter how you bin. 
- You computed the degree assortativity using the pre-implemented networkx function. Skal vi implementere noget selv?¨
- Skal man kun arbejde med largest connected component?

If overskud: 
- Change color of eather "Gryffindor"-house or "Unknown"-house,
so you are able to tell them a part in the graph.
- Add more technical and descriptive markdown sections in the notebook.
- Mixing patterns based on gender, species or house
