1,1,Harry Potter,"I can't let you out, Hedwig. I'm not allowed to use magic outside of school. Besides, if Uncle Vernon-"
2,1,Vernon Dursley,Harry Potter!!
3,1,Harry Potter,Now you've done it.
4,1,Petunia Dursley,"He's in there, Vernon."
5,1,Vernon Dursley,"I'm warning you. If you can't control that bloody bird, it'll have to go."
6,1,Harry Potter,But she's bored. If I could only let her out for… an hour or two.
7,1,Vernon Dursley,"So you can send secret messages to your freaky little friends? No, sir."
8,1,Harry Potter,But I haven't had any messages from any of my friends. Not one. All summer.
9,1,Dudley Dursley,Who would want to be friends with you?
10,1,Vernon Dursley,"I should think you'd be a little more grateful. We've raised you since you were a baby, given you food off our table, even let you have Dudley's second bedroom, purely out of the goodness of our hearts."
11,1,Petunia Dursley,"Not now, bumpkins. It's for when the Masons arrive."
12,1,Vernon Dursley,"Which should be any minute. Now, let's go over the schedule once again, shall we? Petunia, when the Masons arrive, you will be..?"
13,1,Petunia Dursley,"In the lounge, waiting to welcome them graciously to our home."
14,1,Vernon Dursley,"Good. And Dudley, you will be…?"
15,1,Dudley Dursley,I'll be waiting to open the door.
16,1,Vernon Dursley,Excellent. And you…?
17,1,Harry Potter,"I'll be in my bedroom, making no noise and pretending that I don't exist."
18,1,Vernon Dursley,"Too right you will. With any luck, this could well be the day I make the biggest deal of my career, and you will not mess it up."
19,2,Vernon Dursley,Mr. and Mrs. Mason! Do come in!
20,2,Dobby,Harry Potter! Such an honour it is!
21,2,Harry Potter,Who are you?
22,2,Dobby,"Dobby, sir. Dobby the house elf."
23,2,Harry Potter,"Not to be rude or anything, but this isn't a great time for me to have a house elf in my bedroom."
24,2,Dobby,"Oh, oh, yes sir! D-dobby understands! It's just that, Dobby has come to tell you… it is difficult, sir… Dobby wonders where to begin."
25,2,Harry Potter,Why don't you sit down?
26,2,Dobby,S-sit down? S-sit-sit down?
27,2,Harry Potter,"Dobby, sshh!! I'm sorry! I didn't mean to offend you or anything."
28,2,Dobby,"Offend Dobby? Dobby has heard of your greatness, sir, but never has he been asked to sit down by a wizard, like an equal."
29,2,Harry Potter,You can't have met many decent wizards then.
30,2,Dobby,"No, I haven't. That was an awful thing to say! Bad Dobby! Bad Dobby! Bad Dobby!"
31,2,Harry Potter,"Stop, Dobby! Dobby, shh!! Dobby, please stop!"
32,2,Vernon Dursley,"Oh, don't mind that, it's just the…cat."
33,2,Dobby,Bad Dobby!
34,2,Harry Potter,"Dobby, stop! Please be quiet. Are you all right?"
35,2,Dobby,"Dobby had to punish himself, sir. Dobby almost spoke ill of his family, sir."
36,2,Harry Potter,Your family?
37,2,Dobby,"The wizard family Dobby serves, sir. Dobby is bound to serve one family forever. If they ever knew Dobby was here… But Dobby had to come. Dobby has to protect Harry Potter. To warn him. Harry Potter must not go back to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry this year. There is a plot, a plot to make most terrible things happen."
38,2,Harry Potter,What terrible things? Who's plotting them?
39,2,Dobby,"Oh, he! Can't say!"
40,2,Harry Potter,"Okay, I understand. You can't say."
41,2,Dobby,Don't make me talk. Bad Dobby!
42,2,Harry Potter,"Dobby? Dobby, put the lamp down."
43,2,Vernon Dursley,"So, when they arrive at the ninth hole- "
44,2,Harry Potter,"Give me the lamp! Dobby, stop! Get in there and keep quiet!"
45,2,Vernon Dursley,What the devil are you doing up here?!
46,2,Harry Potter,I was just…
47,2,Vernon Dursley,You've just ruined the punchline of my Japanese golfer joke.
48,2,Harry Potter,Sorry.
49,2,Vernon Dursley,"One more sound, and you'll wish you were never born, boy. And fix that door."
50,2,Harry Potter,"Yes sir. See why I've got to go back?! I don't belong here. I belong in your world, at Hogwarts. It's the only place I've got friends."
51,2,Dobby,Friends who don't even write to Harry Potter?
52,2,Harry Potter,"Well I expect they've been… Hang on, how did you know my friends haven't been writing to me?"
53,2,Dobby,"Harry Potter mustn't be angry with Dobby. Dobby hoped if Harry Potter thought his friends had forgotten him, Harry Potter might not want to go back to school, sir"
54,2,Harry Potter,"Give me those, now."
55,2,Dobby,NO!
56,2,Harry Potter,"Dobby, get back here. Dobby, please, no. "
57,2,Dobby,Harry Potter must say he's not going back to school.
58,2,Harry Potter,I can't. Hogwarts is my home.
59,2,Dobby,"Then Dobby must do it, sir. For Harry Potter's own good."
60,2,Vernon Dursley,… and the second plumber said yes and that's just the top of it.
61,2,Vernon Dursley,"I'm so sorry. It's my nephew, he's very disturbed. Meeting strangers upsets him. That's why I kept him upstairs."
62,3,Vernon Dursley,You're never going back to that school. You're never going to see those freaky friends of yours again. Never!
63,3,Ron Weasley,"Hiya, Harry."
64,3,Harry Potter,"Ron, Fred, George, what are you all doing here?"
65,3,Ron Weasley,"Rescuing you, of course. Now, come on. Get your trunk! You'd better stand back. Let's go!"
66,3,Petunia Dursley,Oh!
67,3,Vernon Dursley,Now what the hell's he doing? Potter!
68,3,Dudley Dursley,Dad! What's going on?
69,3,George Weasley,"Go, go, go, go!"
70,3,Dudley Dursley,"Dad, hurry up!"
71,3,Ron Weasley,Come on.
72,3,Fred Weasley,Come on.
73,3,Ron Weasley,"Come on, Harry! Hurry up!"
74,3,Vernon Dursley,"Petunia, he's escaping!"
75,3,Harry Potter,Ahh! Ahh!
76,3,Ron Weasley,I've got you Harry!
77,3,Vernon Dursley,Come here!
78,3,Harry Potter,Let go of me!
79,3,Vernon Dursley,"Oh no, boy! You and that bloody pigeon aren't going anywhere!"
80,3,harry Potter,Get off!
81,3,Ron Weasley,Drive!
82,3,Fred Weasley,Right.
83,3,George Weasley,Right.
84,3,Vernon Dursley,No! No! No! No! Ahhhhh!
85,3,Petunia Dursley,Ahhhhh!
86,3,Dudley Dursley,Ahhhhh! Dad!
87,3,Vernon Dursley,Oh. Damn.
88,3,Ron Weasley,"By the way, Harry, happy birthday!"
89,4,Fred Weasley,"Okay, come on. Shh! Shhh! Okay, come on. Shhhh! Come on."
90,4,Ron Weasley,Do you think it'd be all right if we had some of this?
91,4,George Weasley,"Yeah, Mum would never know."
92,4,Ron Weasley,"It's not much, but it's home."
93,4,Harry Potter,I think it's brilliant.
94,4,Molly Weasley,"Where have you been?! Harry, how wonderful to see you, dear. Beds empty! No note! Car gone! You could have died! You could have been seen! Of course, I don't blame you, Harry dear."
95,4,Ron Weasley,"They were starving him, Mum. There were bars on his window!"
96,4,Molly Weasley,"You'll best hope that I don't put bars on your window, Ronald Weasley! Come on Harry. Time for a spot of breakfast. Here we are, Harry. Now tuck in! That's it. There we go."
97,4,Ginny Weasley,"Mummy, have you seen my jumper?"
98,4,Molly Weasley,"Yes dear, it was on the cat."
99,4,Harry Potter,Hello. W-what did I do?
100,4,Ron Weasley,Ginny. She's been talking about you all summer. Bit annoying really.
101,4,Arthur Weasley,"Morning, Weasleys."
102,4,Fred Weasley,"Morning, Dad."
103,4,George Weasley,"Morning, Dad."
104,4,Ron Weasley,"Morning, Dad."
105,4,Arthur Weasley,What a night. Nine raids. Nine!
106,4,Harry Potter,Raids?
107,4,Ron Weasley,"Dad works in the Ministry of Magic, in the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office. Dad loves Muggles. Thinks they're fascinating."
108,4,Arthur Weasley,Well now. Aah! And who are you?
109,4,Harry Potter,"Oh, sorry sir. I'm Harry sir, Harry Potter."
110,4,Arthur Weasley,"Good Lord! Are you really? Well, Ron's told us all about you, of course. When did he get here?"
111,4,Molly Weasley,This morning. Your sons flew that enchanted car of yours to Surrey and back last night.
112,4,Arthur Weasley,Did you really? How'd it go?
113,4,Molly Weasley,Arthur!
114,4,Arthur Weasley,"I mean, that was very wrong indeed boys, very wrong of you. Now, Harry. You must know all about Muggles. Tell me, what exactly is the function of a rubber duck?"
115,4,Harry Potter,Oh. Um…
116,4,Molly Weasley,"Well that'll be Errol with the post. Oh, fetch it, will you Percy, please?"
117,4,Percy Weasley,Errol.
118,4,Ron Weasley,He's always doing that.
119,4,Percy Weasley,"Oh look, it's our Hogwarts letters."
120,4,Molly Weasley,Oh!
121,4,Percy Weasley,And they've sent us Harry's as well.
122,4,Arthur Weasley,"Dumbledore must know you're here, Harry. Doesn't miss a trick, that man."
123,4,Molly Weasley,"Oh, no."
124,4,Fred Weasley,"This lot won't come cheap, Mum. The spell books alone are very expensive."
125,4,Molly Weasley,We'll manage. There's only one place we're gonna get all of this. Diagon Alley.
126,5,Molly Weasley,"Right. Here we are, Harry. You go first, dear."
127,5,Ron Weasley,"But Harry's never travelled by Floo powder before, Mum."
128,5,Harry Potter,Floo powder?
129,5,Molly Weasley,"Oh well you go first, Ron, so Harry can see how it's done. Yes. In you go. That's it."
130,5,Ron Weasley,Diagon Alley.
131,5,Molly Weasley,"See? It's quite easy, dear. Don't be afraid. Come on. Come on. In you go. That's it, mind your head. That's right. Now take your floo powder. That's it. Very good. Don't forget to speak very, very clearly."
132,5,Harry Potter,Diagonally.
133,5,Molly Weasley,"What did he say, dear?"
134,5,Arthur Weasley,Diagonally.
135,5,Molly Weasley,I thought he did.
136,5,Harry Potter,Ahh! Ah!
137,5,Creepy Witch,"Not lost are you, my dear?"
138,5,Harry Potter,"I'm fine, thank you. I-I was just…"
139,5,Creepy Witch,Come with us. We'll help you find your way back.
140,5,Harry Potter,No. Please.
141,5,Rubeus Hagrid,Harry?
142,5,Harry Potter,Hagrid!
143,5,Rubeus Hagrid,"What do you think you're doing down here? Come on. You're a mess, Harry. Skulking 'round Knockturn Alley. Dodgy place! Don't let no one see you there. People'll think you were up to no good!"
144,5,Harry Potter,"I was lost! Hang on, what were you doing down there, then?"
145,5,Rubeus Hagrid,"Me? Oh, I was um… I was looking for flesh-eating slug repellent. They're ruining all the school cabbages."
146,5,Hermione Granger,Harry! Hagrid! 
147,5,Rubeus Hagrid,Hello Hermione.
148,5,Hermione Granger,Oh it's so good to see you!
149,5,Harry Potter,Oh it's great to see you too.
150,5,Hermione Granger,What did you do to your glasses? Oculus Reparo.
151,5,Harry Potter,I definitely need to remember that one.
152,5,Rubeus Hagrid,"You'll be all right now then, Harry? I'll leave you to it."
153,5,Hermione Granger,"Okay, bye!"
154,5,Harry Potter,Thank you. Bye.
155,5,Hermione Granger,Come on. Everyone's been so worried.
156,6,Molly Weasley,"Oh, Harry! Thank goodness! We'd hoped you'd only gone one grate too far!"
157,6,Announcer,"Ladies and gentleman, Mr. Gilderoy Lockhart."
158,6,Molly Weasley,Ah! Here he is!
159,6,Ron Weasley,Mum fancies him.
160,6,Photographer,"Make way there. Please! Let me by, madam. Thank you. Excuse me, little girl. This is for the Daily Prophet."
161,6,Gilderoy Lockhart,"It can't be, Harry Potter?"
162,6,Photographer,"Harry Potter! Excuse me, Madam!"
163,6,Gilderoy Lockhart,"Nice big smile, Harry. Together you and I rate the front page! Ladies and gentlemen, what an extraordinary moment this is. When young Harry stepped into Flourish and Blotts this morning to purchase my autobiography, Magical Me, which incidentally is currently celebrating its twenty-seventh week atop the Daily Prophet best seller list, he had no idea that he would in fact be leaving with my entire collected works, free of charge. Now, ladies."
164,6,Molly Weasley,"Ah, Harry! Now you give me those, and I'll get them signed, all of you wait outside. That's it, Ron."
165,6,Draco Malfoy,"I'll bet you loved that, didn't you Potter? Famous Harry Potter! Can't even go into a bookshop without making the front page!"
166,6,Ginny Weasley,Leave him alone.
167,6,Draco Malfoy,"Oh look, Potter. You've got yourself a girlfriend. "
168,6,Lucius Malfoy,"Now, now, Draco. Play nicely. Mr. Potter… Lucius Malfoy. We meet at last. Forgive me, your scar is legend, as of course is the wizard who gave it to you."
169,6,Harry Potter,Voldemort killed my parents. He was nothing more than a murderer.
170,6,Lucius Malfoy,"Hmm. You must be very brave, to mention his name, or very foolish."
171,6,Hermione Granger,Fear of a name only increases fear of the thing itself.
172,6,Lucius Malfoy,"And you must be… Miss Granger. Yes, Draco's told me all about you, and your parents. Muggles, aren't they? Let me see… red hair… vacant expressions… tatty second hand book. You must be Weasleys."
173,6,Arthur Weasley,"Children, it's mad in here! Let's go outside."
174,6,Lucius Malfoy,"Well, well, well. Weasley senior."
175,6,Arthur Weasley,Lucius.
176,6,Lucius Malfoy,"Busy time at the Ministry, Arthur? All those extra raids? I do hope they're paying you overtime, but judging by the state of this, I'd say not. What's the use in being a disgrace to the name of the wizard if they don't pay you well for it?"
177,6,Arthur Weasley,"We have a very different idea about what disgraces the name of wizard, Malfoy."
178,6,Lucius Malfoy,Clearly. Associating with Muggles… and I thought your family could sink no lower. I'll see you at work.
179,6,Draco Malfoy,See you at school.
180,7,Arthur Weasley,"Ten-fifty-eight! Come on, come on!"
181,7,Molly Weasley,The train will be leaving any moment!
182,7,Arthur Weasley,"Fred, George, Percy, you first!"
183,7,Molly Weasley,Okay.
184,7,Arthur Weasley,"After you, dear."
185,7,Molly Weasley,"Come on, Ginny, we'll get you a seat. Hurry!"
186,7,Harry Potter,Let's go. Ahhhh!
187,7,Ron Weasley,Whoaa!
188,7,Guard,Oy! What do you two think you're doing?
189,7,Harry Potter,Sorry. Lost- lost control of the trolley. Why can't we get through?
190,7,Ron Weasley,I don't know. The gateway's sealed itself for some reason.
191,7,Harry Potter,The train leaves at exactly eleven o'clock. We've missed it!
192,7,Ron Weasley,"Harry, if we can't get through, maybe Mum and Dad can't get back!"
193,7,Harry Potter,Maybe we should just go and wait by the car.
194,7,Ron Weasley,The car…
195,7,Harry Potter,"Ron, I should tell you, most Muggles aren't accustomed to seeing a flying car."
196,7,Ron Weasley,"Uh, right. Okay."
197,7,Harry Potter,Now all we need to do is catch up with the train.
198,7,Ron Weasley,We can't be far behind.
199,7,Harry Potter,Do you hear that?
200,7,Ron Weasley,We must be getting close.
201,7,Harry Potter,Hold on…
202,7,Ron Weasley,Ahhhhh! Ahhhhh! Ahhhhh!
203,7,Harry Potter,Wha-aahhhhh!
204,7,Ron Weasley,Harry! Hold on! Take my hand! Hold on!
205,7,Harry Potter,I'm trying. Your hand's all sweaty.
206,7,Harry Potter,I think we found the train.
207,7,Ron Weasley,Yeah.
208,8,Ron Weasley,Welcome home.
209,8,Harry Potter,Up! Up!
210,8,Ron Weasley,It's not working! Ahhhhh!
211,8,Harry Potter,Up! Up! Ron! Mind that tree!
212,8,Ron Weasley,Stop! Stop! Stop! Huh… Ahhhhh!
213,8,Harry Potter,Ahhhhh!
214,8,Ron Weasley,Ahh…ahh! My wand! Look at my wand!
215,8,Harry Potter,Be thankful it's not your neck.
216,8,Ron Weasley,What's happening?
217,8,Harry Potter,I don't know.
218,8,Ron Weasley,Ahhhhh! Ahhhhh! Ahhhhh!
219,8,Harry Potter,Ahhhhh! Ahhhhh! Ahhhhh! Come on! Go! Fast!
220,8,Ron Weasley,Ahhhhh!
221,8,Ron Weasley,"Scabbers, you okay? The car! Dad's gonna kill me."
222,9,Harry Potter,"See you, Hedwig. So, a house elf shows up in my bedroom, we can't get through the barrier to platform nine and three-quarters, we almost get killed by a tree… clearly someone doesn't want me here this year."
223,9,Argus Filch,"Well, take a look lads. This night might well be the last you spend in this castle. Hmm. Oh dear, we are in trouble."
224,9,Severus Snape,You were seen by no less than seven Muggles. Do you have any idea how serious this is? You have risked exposure of our world. Not to mention the damage you have inflicted on a Whomping Willow that's been on these grounds since before you were born.
225,9,Ron Weasley,"Honestly, Professor Snape, I think it did more damage to us."
226,9,Severus Snape,"Silence! I assure you, that were you in Slytherin, and your fate rested with me, the both of you would be on the train home, tonight. As it is…"
227,9,Albus Dumbledore,…They are not.
228,9,Harry Potter,Professor Dumbledore. Professor McGonagall.
229,9,Severus Snape,"Headmaster, these boys have flouted the Decree for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry. As such-"
230,9,Albus Dumbledore,"I am well aware of our bylaws, Severus, having written quite a few of them myself. However, as head of Gryffindor house, it is for Professor McGonagall to determine the appropriate action."
231,9,Ron Weasley,"We'll go and get our stuff, then."
232,9,Minerva McGonagall,"What are you talking about, Mr. Weasley?"
233,9,Ron Weasley,"You're going to expel us, aren't you?"
234,9,Minerva McGonagall,"Not today, Mr. Weasley. But, I must impress on both of you the seriousness of what you have done. I will be writing to your families tonight, and you will both receive detention."
235,10,Pomona Sprout,"Morning, everyone! Good morning, everyone!"
236,10,Class,"Good morning, Professor Sprout!"
237,10,Pomona Sprout,"Welcome to Greenhouse Three, second years. Now, gather around, everyone. Today, we are going to repot Mandrakes. Who here can tell me the properties of the Mandrake root? Yes, Miss Granger."
238,10,Hermione Granger,"Mandrake, or Mandragora, is used to return those who have been petrified to their original state. It's also quite dangerous. The Mandrake's cry is fatal to anyone who hears it."
239,10,Pomona Sprout,"Excellent! Ten points to Gryffindor! Now, as our Mandrakes are still only seedlings their cries won't kill you yet. But they could knock you out for several hours, which is why I have given each of you a pair of earmuffs for auditory protection. So, could you please put them on, right away? Quickly! Flaps tight down, and watch me closely. You grasp your Mandrake firmly, you pull it sharply up out of the pot."
240,10,Class,Ahh! Oooh!
241,10,Pomona Sprout,Got it? And… now you dunk it down into the other pot and pour a little sprinkling of soil to keep him warm.
242,10,Neville Longbottom,Uhh…
243,10,Pomona Sprout,"Uh, Longbottom's been neglecting his earmuffs."
244,10,Seamus Finnigan,"No, ma'am, he's just fainted."
245,10,Pomona Sprout,"Yes, well, just leave him there. Right! On we go! Plenty of pots to go around. Grasp your Mandrake and pull it up!"
246,10,Nearly Headless Nick,"Hello, Percy. Miss Clearwater."
247,10,Percy Weasley,"Hello, Sir Nicholas!"
248,10,Ron Weasley,"Huh… Say it, I'm doomed."
249,10,Harry Potter,You're doomed.
250,10,Colin Creevey,"Hi, Harry! I'm Colin Creevey! I'm in Gryffindor, too!"
251,10,Harry Potter,"Oh, hi, Colin. Nice to meet you."
252,10,Dean Thomas,Ron? Is that your owl?
253,10,Ron Weasley,"Bloody bird's a menace! Oh, no!"
254,10,Seamus Finnigan,"Look, everyone! Weasley's got himself a Howler!"
255,10,Neville Longbottom,"Go on, Ron. I ignored one from my gran once. It was horrible."
256,10,Molly Weasley,"RONALD WEASLEY! HOW DARE YOU STEAL THAT CAR! I AM ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTED! YOUR FATHER'S NOW FACING AN INQUIRY AT WORK, AND IT'S ENTIRELY YOUR FAULT! YOU PUT ANOTHER TOE OUT OF LINE, WE'LL BRING YOU STRAIGHT HOME! Oh, and Ginny, dear, congratulations on making Gryffindor. Your father and I are so proud."
257,11,Gilderoy Lockhart,"Let me introduce you to your new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher… me! Gilderoy Lockhart, Order of Merlin, Third Class, Honorary Member of the Dark Force Defense League, and five-times winner of Witch Weekly's Most Charming Smile Award. But I don't talk about that. I didn't get rid of the Bandon Banshee by smiling at him. Hee, hee, hee... Now, be warned! It is my job to arm you against the foulest creatures known to wizardkind. You may find yourselves facing your worst fears in this room. Know only that no harm can befall you whilst I am here. I must ask you not to scream. It might... provoke them!"
258,11,Seamus Finnigan,Cornish pixies?
259,11,Gilderoy Lockhart,Freshly caught Cornish pixies!
260,11,Seamus Finnigan,Ha ha ha ha ha…
261,11,Gilderoy Lockhart,"Laugh if you will, Mr. Finnigan, but pixies can be devilish tricky little blighters. Let's see what you make of them. Ha! Come on now, round them up, round them up, they're only pixies!"
262,11,Neville Longbottom,Ahhh! Ahhhhh! Ahhh! Ahhhh! Hey! Get me down!
263,11,Hermione Granger,Get off me!
264,11,Harry Potter,Stop! Stop! Hold still!
265,11,Gilderoy Lockhart,Peskipiksi pesternomi! I'll ask you three to just nip the rest of them back into their cage!
266,11,Ron Weasley,What do we do now?
267,11,Hermione Granger,Immobulus!
268,11,Neville Longbottom,Why is it always me?
269,12,Oliver Wood,"I spent the summer devising a whole new Quidditch program. We are gonna train earlier, harder, and longer. What… I don't believe it! Where do you think you're going, Flint?"
270,12,Marcus Flint,Quidditch practice.
271,12,Oliver Wood,I booked the pitch for Gryffindor today.
272,12,Marcus Flint,"Easy, Wood. I've got a note."
273,12,Ron Weasley,Uh-oh. I smell trouble.
274,12,Oliver Wood,"I, Professor Severus Snape, do hereby give the Slytherin team permission to practice today, owing to the need to train their new Seeker. You’ve got a new Seeker. Who?"
275,12,Harry Potter,Malfoy?
276,12,Draco Malfoy,That's right. And that's not all that's new this year.
277,12,Ron Weasley,Those are Nimbus Two Thousand and Ones! How did you get those?
278,12,Marcus Flint,A gift from Draco's father.
279,12,Draco Malfoy,"You see Weasley, unlike some, my father can afford the best."
280,12,Hermione Granger,At least no one on the Gryffindor team had to buy their way in. They got in on pure talent.
281,12,Draco Malfoy,"No one asked your opinion, you filthy little Mudblood!"
282,12,Ron Weasley,You'll pay for that one Malfoy! Eat slugs!
283,12,Draco Malfoy,Ha ha!
284,12,Hermione Granger,"You okay, Ron? Say something!"
285,12,Colin Creevey,"Wow! Can you turn him around, Harry?"
286,12,Harry Potter,"No, Colin! Get out of the way! Let's take him to Hagrid's. He'll know what to do."
287,12,Rubeus Hagrid,"Wow, this calls for a specialist's equipment. Nothing to do but wait til it stops, I'm afraid."
288,12,Harry Potter,"Ah! Oh, okay."
289,12,Rubeus Hagrid,Better out than in. Who was Ron trying to curse anyway?
290,12,Harry Potter,"Malfoy. He called Hermione… um, well, I don't- I don’t know exactly what it means."
291,12,Hermione Granger,He called me a Mudblood.
292,12,Rubeus Hagrid,He did not!
293,12,Harry Potter,What's a Mudblood?
294,12,Hermione Granger,It means dirty blood. Mudblood's a really foul name for someone who is Muggle-born. Someone with non-magic parents. Someone like me. It's not a term one usually hears in civilized conversation.
295,12,Rubeus Hagrid,"See, the thing is, Harry, there are some wizards, like the Malfoy family, who think they're better than anyone else because they're what people call 'pure blood'."
296,12,Harry Potter,That's horrible!
297,12,Ron Weasley,It's disgusting.
298,12,Rubeus Hagrid,"And it's codswallop, to boot. Dirty blood. Why, there isn't a wizard alive today that's not half blood or less. More to the point, they've yet to think of a spell that our Hermione can't do. Come here… Don't you think on it, Hermione. Don't you think on it for one minute... eh?"
299,12,Gilderoy Lockhart,"Harry, Harry, Harry… Can you possibly imagine a better way to serve detention than helping me to answer my fan mail?"
300,12,Harry Potter,Not really.
301,12,Gilderoy Lockhart,"Fame is a fickle friend, Harry. Celebrity is as celebrity does. Remember that."
302,12,Basilisk,"Come, come, come to me. Come to me!"
303,12,Harry Potter,What?
304,12,Gilderoy Lockhart,Sorry?
305,12,Harry Potter,That voice.
306,12,Gilderoy Lockhart,Voice?
307,12,Harry Potter,Didn't you hear it?
308,12,Gilderoy Lockhart,"What are you talking about, Harry? I think we're getting a bit drowsy. And, Great Scott, no wonder! Look at the time! We've been here for nearly four hours! Spooky how the time flies when one's having fun. Heh heh."
309,12,Harry Potter,Spooky.
310,13,Basilisk,Blood. I smell blood. Let me rip you. Let me kill you. Kill! Kill! Kill!
311,13,Hermione Granger,Harry!
312,13,Harry Potter,Did you hear it?
313,13,Ron Weasley,Hear what?
314,13,Harry Potter,That voice.
315,13,Hermione Granger,Voice? What voice?
316,13,Harry Potter,I heard it first in Lockhart's office. And then again just-
317,13,Basilisk,It's time.
318,13,Harry Potter,It's moving.. I think it's going to kill.
319,13,Ron Weasley,Kill?
320,13,Hermione Granger,"Harry, wait! Not so fast!"
321,13,Harry Potter,Strange. I've never seen spiders act like that.
322,13,Ron Weasley,I don't like spiders. What's that?
323,13,Hermione Granger,"The chamber of secrets has been opened. Enemies of the heir, beware. It's written in blood."
324,13,Harry Potter,Oh no. It's Filch's cat. It's Mrs. Norris.
325,13,Pomona Sprout,Oh!
326,13,Draco Malfoy,"Enemies of the heir, beware? You'll be next, Mudbloods!"
327,13,Argus Filch,"What's going on here? Go on, make way, make way. Potter… What are you- Mrs Norris? You've... murdered my cat."
328,13,Harry Potter,No. No.
329,13,Argus Filch,I'll kill ya… I'll kill ya!
330,13,Albus Dumbledore,Argus! Argus! I… Everyone will proceed to their dormitories immediately. Everyone except… you three. She's not dead Argus. She has been petrified.
331,13,Gilderoy Lockhart,"Ah, thought so. So unlucky I wasn't there. I know exactly the counter curse that could have spared her."
332,13,Albus Dumbledore,"But how she has been petrified, I cannot say."
333,13,Argus Filch,Ask him. It's him who's done it. You saw what he wrote on that wall.
334,13,Harry Potter,"It's not true, sir, I swear. I never touched Mrs. Norris."
335,13,Argus Filch,Rubbish!
336,13,Severus Snape,"If I might, Headmaster? Perhaps Potter and his friends were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. However, the circumstances are suspicious. I, for one, don't recall seeing Potter at dinner."
337,13,Gilderoy Lockhart,"I'm afraid that's my doing, Severus. You see, Harry was helping me answer my fan mail."
338,13,Hermione Granger,"That's why Ron and I went looking for him, Professor. We'd just found him when he said…"
339,13,Severus Snape,"Yes, Miss Granger?"
340,13,Harry Potter,When I said I wasn't hungry. We were heading back to the common room when we found Mrs. Norris.
341,13,Albus Dumbledore,"Innocent until proven guilty, Severus."
342,13,Argus Filch,My cat has been petrified. I wanna see some punishment!
343,13,Albus Dumbledore,"We will be able to cure her, Argus. As I understand it, Madame Sprout has a very healthy growth of Mandrakes. When matured, a potion will be made which will revive Mrs. Norris. And in the meantime, I strongly recommend caution… to all."
344,13,Hermione Granger,"It's a bit strange, isn't it?"
345,13,Harry Potter,Strange?
346,13,Hermione Granger,"You hear this voice, a voice only you can hear, and then Mrs. Norris turns up petrified. It's just... strange."
347,13,Harry Potter,"Do you think I should have told them? Dumbledore and the others, I mean?"
348,13,Ron Weasley,Are you mad?
349,13,Hermione Granger,"No, Harry. Even in the wizarding world, hearing voices isn't a good sign."
350,14,Minerva McGonagall,"Could I have your attention, please? Right. Now, today, we will be transforming animals into water goblets. Like so. One, two, three, Vera Verto. Now it's your turn. Well, who would like to go first? Ah! Mr. Weasley! One, two, three. Vera Verto."
351,14,Ron Weasley,Ahem. Vera Verto!
352,14,Minerva McGonagall,"That wand needs replacing, Mr. Weasley. Yes, Miss Granger?"
353,14,Hermione Granger,"Professor, I was wondering if you could tell us about… the Chamber of Secrets?"
354,14,Minerva McGonagall,"Well, very well. Well, you all know, of course, that Hogwarts was founded over a thousand years ago by the four greatest witches and wizards of the age. Godric Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw, and Salazar Slytherin. Now, three of the founders coexisted quite harmoniously. One did not."
355,14,Ron Weasley,Three guesses who.
356,14,Minerva McGonagall,"Salazar Slytherin wished to be more selective about the students admitted to Hogwarts. He believed magical learning should be kept within all-magic families. In other words, pure bloods. Unable to sway the others, he decided to leave the school. Now, according to legend, Slytherin had built a hidden chamber in this castle, known as the Chamber of Secrets. Though, shortly before departing, he sealed it until that time when his own true heir returned to the school. The heir alone would be able to open the Chamber and unleash the horror within, and by so doing, purge the school of all those who, in Slytherin's view, were unworthy to study magic."
357,14,Hermione Granger,Muggle-borns.
358,14,Minerva McGonagall,"Well, naturally, the school has been searched many times. No such chamber has been found."
359,14,Hermione Granger,Professor? What exactly does legend tell us lies within the Chamber?
360,14,Minerva McGonagall,"Well, the Chamber is said to be home to something that only the heir of Slytherin can control. It is said to be the home… of a monster."
361,14,Ron Weasley,Do you think it's true? Do you think there really is a Chamber of Secrets?
362,14,Hermione Granger,Yes. Couldn't you tell? McGonagall's worried. All the teachers are.
363,14,Harry Potter,"Well, if there really is a Chamber of Secrets, a-and it really has been opened, then that means…"
364,14,Hermione Granger,"The heir of Slytherin has returned to Hogwarts. The question is, who is it?"
365,14,Ron Weasley,Let's think. Who do we know who thinks all Muggle-borns are scum?
366,14,Hermione Granger,If you're talking about Malfoy.
367,14,Ron Weasley,Of course! You heard him! You'll be next Mudbloods.
368,14,Hermione Granger,"I heard him. But Malfoy, the heir of Slytherin?"
369,14,Harry Potter,"Well, maybe Ron's right, Hermione. I mean, look at his family. The whole lot of them have been in Slytherin for centuries."
370,14,Ron Weasley,Crabbe and Goyle must know. Maybe we could trick them into telling.
371,14,Hermione Granger,"Even they aren't that thick. But there might be another way. Mind you, it would be difficult. Not to mention, we would be breaking about fifty school rules. And, it'll be dangerous. Very dangerous."
372,15,Hermione Granger,"Here it is. The Polyjuice Potion. Properly brewed, the Polyjuice Potion allows the drinker to transform himself temporarily into the physical form of another. "
373,15,Ron Weasley,"Do you mean, if Harry and I drink that stuff, we'll turn into Crabbe and Goyle?"
374,15,Hermione Granger,Yes.
375,15,Ron Weasley,Wicked! Malfoy will tell us anything.
376,15,Hermione Granger,Exactly. But it's tricky. I've never seen a more complicated potion.
377,15,Harry Potter,"Well, how long will it take to make?"
378,15,Hermione Granger,A month.
379,15,Harry Potter,"A month? But, Hermione, if Malfoy is the heir of Slytherin, he could attack half the Muggle-borns in the school by then."
380,15,Hermione Granger,I know. But it's the only plan we've got.
381,15,Lee Jordan,Another goal for Slytherin! They lead Gryffindor ninety to thirty!
382,15,Marcus Flint,Yeah! Yeah!
383,15,Draco Malfoy,"All right there, Scarhead?"
384,15,Oliver Wood,"Watch yourself, Harry!"
385,15,Harry Potter,Wood! Look out!
386,15,Rubeus Hagrid,"Blimey! Harry's got himself a rogue Bludger! That’s been tampered with, that has!"
387,15,Ron Weasley,I'll stop it.
388,15,Hermione Granger,No! Even with a proper wand it's too risky. You could hit Harry!
389,15,Draco Malfoy,"Training for the ballet, Potter? You'll never catch me, Potter!"
390,15,Hermione Granger,Let's go.
391,15,Lee Jordan,Harry Potter has caught the Snitch! Gryffindor wins!
392,15,Hermione Granger,Finite incantatem.
393,16,Harry Potter,Thank you.
394,16,Hermione Granger,Are you okay?
395,16,Harry Potter,"No, I think my… I think my arm's broken."
396,16,Gilderoy Lockhart,"Not to worry, Harry. I will fix that arm of yours straight away."
397,16,Harry Potter,"No, not you."
398,16,Gilderoy Lockhart,"Oh, poor boy doesn't know what he's saying. Now, this… won't hurt a bit. Brackium emendo! Ah, yes, well, ha, that can sometimes happen, um, but uh, the point is, uh… you can no longer feel any pain, and, heh, very clearly, the bones are not broken."
399,16,Rubeus Hagrid,Broken? There's no bones left!
400,16,Gilderoy Lockhart,"Much more flexible, though."
401,16,Draco Malfoy,Uhhh… Uhhh…
402,16,Poppy Pomfrey,"Oh, Mr. Malfoy, stop making a fuss, you can go. Out of my way. Out of my way! Should've been brought straight to me. I can mend bones in a heartbeat, but growing them back…"
403,16,Hermione Granger,"You will be able to, won't you?"
404,16,Poppy Pomfrey,"Oh, I'll be able to certainly. But it'll be painful. You're in for a rough night, Potter. Regrowing bones is a nasty business."
405,16,Harry Potter,Ugh!
406,16,Poppy Pomfrey,"Well, what do you expect? Pumpkin juice?"
407,16,Harry Potter,Ugh!
408,16,Basilisk,Kill. Kill… Time to kill!
409,16,Dobby,Hello!
410,16,Harry Potter,Dobby?
411,16,Dobby,Harry Potter should have listened to Dobby! Harry Potter should have gone back home when he missed the train.
412,16,Harry Potter,It was you… You stopped the barrier from letting Ron and me through.
413,16,Dobby,"Indeed. Yes, sir."
414,16,Harry Potter,You nearly got Ron and me expelled!
415,16,Dobby,At least you would be away from here. Harry Potter must go home! Dobby thought his Bludger would be enough to make Harry Potter see that.
416,16,Harry Potter,Your Bludger? You made that Bludger chase after me?
417,16,Dobby,"Uh huh… Dobby feels most aggrieved, sir. Dobby had to iron his hands."
418,16,Harry Potter,"You'd better clear off before my bones come back, Dobby, or I might strangle you!"
419,16,Dobby,"Uh, huh, huh… Dobby is used to death threats, sir. Dobby gets them five times a day at home."
420,16,Harry Potter,I don't suppose you could tell me why you're trying to kill me?
421,16,Dobby,"Not kill you, sir, never kill you! Dobby remembers how it was before Harry Potter triumphed over He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. We house elves were treated like vermin, sir. Of course, Dobby is still treated like vermin.. Uh, huh, huh, huh! Ahhhh! Ahh!"
422,16,Harry Potter,"Why do you wear that thing, Dobby?"
423,16,Dobby,"This, sir? It is a mark of the house-elves' enslavement. Dobby can only be freed if his master presents him with clothes. Ah! Listen. Listen! Terrible things are about to happen at Hogwarts. Harry Potter must not stay here, now that history is to repeat itself."
424,16,Harry Potter,Repeat itself? You mean this has happened before?
425,16,Dobby,Ah! I shouldn’t have said that! Oh! Ah! Dah! Bad Dobby! Bad!
426,16,Harry Potter,"Dobby, stop it! Stop it! Stop, Dobby! Tell me, Dobby. When did this happen before? Who's doing it now?"
427,16,Dobby,"Dobby cannot say, sir. Dobby only wants Harry Potter to be safe."
428,16,Harry Potter,"No, Dobby. Tell me. Who is it?"
429,16,Poppy Pomfrey,Put him here. What happened?
430,16,Albus Dumbledore,There's been another attack.
431,16,Minerva McGonagall,"I think, do you know, I think he's been petrified, Madame Pomfrey. Look! Perhaps he managed to take a picture of his attacker… What can this mean, Albus?"
432,16,Albus Dumbledore,It means… that our students are in great danger.
433,16,Minerva McGonagall,What should I tell the staff?
434,16,Albus Dumbledore,"The truth. Tell them Hogwarts is no longer safe. It is as we feared, Minerva. The Chamber of Secrets has indeed been opened again."
435,17,Hermione Granger,Again? You mean the Chamber of Secrets has been opened before?
436,17,Ron Weasley,Of course. Don't you see? Lucius Malfoy must have opened it when he was at school here. And now he's taught Draco how to do it.
437,17,Hermione Granger,Maybe. We'll have to wait for the Polyjuice Potion to know for sure.
438,17,Ron Weasley,"Enlighten me. Why are we brewing this potion in broad daylight, in the middle of a girl's lavatory? Don't you think we'll get caught?"
439,17,Hermione Granger,Heh… No. No one ever comes in here.
440,17,Ron Weasley,Why?
441,17,Hermione Granger,Moaning Myrtle.
442,17,Ron Weasley,Who?
443,17,Hermione Granger,Moaning Myrtle.
444,17,Ron Weasley,Who's Moaning Myrtle?
445,17,Moaning Myrtle,"I'm Moaning Myrtle! I wouldn't expect you to know me! Who would ever talk about ugly, miserable, moping Moaning Myrtle? Huh… ahhhhhh!!"
446,17,Hermione Granger,She's a little sensitive.
447,17,Gilderoy Lockhart,"Gather ‘round, gather ‘round! Can everybody see me? Can you all hear me? Excellent! In light of the dark events of recent weeks, Professor Dumbledore has granted me permission to start this little Dueling Club to train you all up in case you ever need to defend yourselves, as I myself have done on countless occasions- for full details, see my published works. Let me introduce my assistant, Professor Snape. He has sportingly agreed to help me with a short demonstration. Now, I don’t want any of you youngsters to worry- you’ll still have your Potions master when I’m through with him, never fear. One, two, three."
448,17,Severus Snape,Expelliarmus!
449,17,Gilderoy Lockhart,Whooooah!
450,17,Hermione Granger,Do you think he's all right?
451,17,Ron Weasley,Who cares?
452,17,Gilderoy Lockhart,"An excellent idea to show them that, Professor Snape, but if you don't mind me saying, it was pretty obvious, uh, what you were about to do. And if I had wanted to stop you, it would have been only too easy."
453,17,Severus Snape,"Perhaps it would be prudent to first teach the students to block unfriendly spells, Professor."
454,17,Gilderoy Lockhart,"An excellent suggestion, Professor Snape! Ah… let's have a volunteer pair! Um, Potter, Weasley, how about you?"
455,17,Severus Snape,"Weasley's wand causes devastation with the simplest spells. We'll be sending Potter to the hospital wing in a matchbox. Might I suggest someone from my own house? Malfoy, perhaps?"
456,17,Gilderoy Lockhart,"Good luck, Potter."
457,17,Harry Potter,"Thank you, sir."
458,17,Gilderoy Lockhart,Wands at the ready.
459,17,Draco Malfoy,"Scared, Potter?"
460,17,Harry Potter,You wish.
461,17,Gilderoy Lockhart,"On the count of three, cast your charms to disarm your opponent- only to disarm. We don't want any accidents here. One, two-"
462,17,Draco Malfoy,Everte statium!
463,17,Hermione Granger,Oh!
464,17,Vincent Crabbe,Ha ha ha ha ha!
465,17,Harry Potter,Rictusempra!
466,18,Gilderoy Lockhart,I said disarm only!
467,18,Draco Malfoy,Serpensortia!
468,18,Severus Snape,"Don't move, Potter. I'll get rid of it for you."
469,18,Gilderoy Lockhart,"Allow me, Professor Snape. Alarte ascendare!"
470,18,Harry Potter,Sya hassa she. Sya hasi heth. Sya hasi heth.
471,18,Severus Snape,Vipera evenesca.
472,18,Justin Finch-Fletchley,What are you playing at?!
473,18,Ron Weasley,You're a Parselmouth? Why didn't you tell us?
474,18,Harry Potter,I'm a what?
475,18,Hermione Granger,You can talk to snakes.
476,18,Harry Potter,"I know. I mean, I accidentally set a python on my cousin Dudley at the zoo once. Uh, once! But, so what? I bet loads of people here can do it."
477,18,Hermione Granger,"No, they can't. It's not a very common gift Harry. This is bad."
478,18,Harry Potter,What's bad? If I hadn't told that snake not to attack Justin-
479,18,Ron Weasley,"Oh, that's what you said to it!"
480,18,Harry Potter,You were there! You heard me!
481,18,Ron Weasley,I heard you speaking Parseltongue. Snake language?
482,18,Harry Potter,I spoke a different language? But… I didn't realise I- how can I speak a language without knowing I can?
483,18,Hermione Granger,"I don't know, Harry, but it sounded like you were egging the snake on, or something. Harry, listen to me. There's a reason the symbol of Slytherin House is a serpent. Salazar Slytherin was a Parselmouth. He could talk to snakes, too."
484,18,Ron Weasley,Exactly! Now the whole school's gonna think you're his great-great-great grandson or something.
485,18,Harry Potter,But I'm not. I can't be.
486,18,Hermione Granger,"He lived a thousand years ago. For all we know, you could be."
487,18,Harry Potter,I'll see you back in the common room.
488,18,Basilisk,"Blood. I want blood. They must all die. Kill, kill, kill! Time to kill."
489,19,Argus Filch,"Caught in the act! I'll have you out this time, Potter. Mark my words."
490,19,Harry Potter,No! Mr. Filch! Y-you-you don't understand!
491,19,Minerva McGonagall,Oh!
492,19,Harry Potter,Professor… I swear I didn't!
493,19,Minerva McGonagall,"This is out of my hands, Potter."
494,19,Minerva McGonagall,Professor Dumbledore will be waiting for you. Sherbet lemon.
495,19,Harry Potter,Professor Dumbledore?
496,19,Sorting Hat,"Bee in your bonnet, Potter?"
497,19,Harry Potter,I… I-I was - I was just wondering if you'd put me in the right house.
498,19,Sorting Hat,"Yes, you were particularly difficult to place. But, I stand by what I said last year- you would have done well in Slytherin."
499,19,Harry Potter,You're wrong.
500,19,Sorting Hat,Umm…
501,19,Albus Dumbledore,Harry?
502,19,Harry Potter,"Professor! Sir, your bird… there was nothing I could do! He- he just caught fire!"
503,19,Albus Dumbledore,"Oh, and about time too. He's been looking dreadful for days. Pity you had to see him on a burning day. Fawkes is a phoenix, Harry. They burst into flames when it is time for them to die, and then they are reborn from the ashes. Ah, fascinating creatures, phoenixes. They can carry immensely heavy loads, and their tears have healing powers."
504,19,Rubeus Hagrid,"Professor Dumbledore, sir! Wait! Listen! Professor Dumbledore, sir, it wasn't Harry!"
505,19,Albus Dumbledore,Hagrid.
506,19,Rubeus Hagrid,"In fact, I'd be prepared to swear it in front of the Ministry of Magic!"
507,19,Albus Dumbledore,Hagrid! Relax. I do not believe that Harry attacked anyone.
508,19,Rubeus Hagrid,"Well of course you don't, and… Oh, oh right. Well, I'll, umm. I'll just wait outside then."
509,19,Albus Dumbledore,Yes.
510,19,Harry Potter,"You don't think it was me, Professor?"
511,19,Albus Dumbledore,"No, Harry. I do not think it was you… But I must ask you, is there something you wish to tell me?"
512,19,Harry Potter,"No sir, nothing."
513,19,Albus Dumbledore,"Very well, then. Off you go."
514,20,Hermione Granger,Everything's set. We just need a bit of who you're changing into.
515,20,Harry Potter,Crabbe and Goyle.
516,20,Hermione Granger,We also need to make sure that the real Crabbe and Goyle can't burst in on us while we're interrogating Malfoy.
517,20,Ron Weasley,How?
518,20,Hermione Granger,"I've got it all worked out. I filled these with a simple Sleeping Draught. Simple, but powerful. Now, once they're asleep, hide them in the broomstick cupboard and pull out a few of their hairs, and put on their uniforms."
519,20,Ron Weasley,Whose hair are you ripping out then?
520,20,Hermione Granger,"I've already got mine. Millicent Bulstrode, Slytherin, I got this off her robes. I'm going to go check on the Polyjuice Potion. Make sure that Crabbe and Goyle find these."
521,20,Ron Weasley,Ahem…
522,20,Harry Potter,"Ron, maybe I should do it?"
523,20,Ron Weasley,Yeah. Right.
524,20,Harry Potter,Wingardium Leviosa. Here they come.
525,20,Vincent Crabbe,"It's good, right? Ah… cool! Nom nom."
526,20,Gregory Goyle,Nom nom.
527,20,Ron Weasley,How thick could you get?
528,20,Harry Potter,Come on. Let's get em.
529,20,Hermione Granger,We'll have exactly one hour before we change back into ourselves. Add the hairs.
530,20,Ron Weasley,Ugh! Essence of Crabbe.
531,20,Hermione Granger,Cheers!
532,20,Ron Weasley,I think I'm gonna be sick!
533,20,Hermione Granger,Me too.
534,20,Harry Potter,Eughhh!
535,20,Ron Weasley,Uh… Harry?
536,20,Harry Potter,Ron!
537,20,Ron Weasley,Bloody hell!
538,20,Harry Potter,We still sound like ourselves. You need to sound more like Crabbe.
539,20,Ron Weasley,Uh… Bloody hell.
540,20,Harry Potter,Excellent.
541,20,Ron Weasley,But where's Hermione?
542,20,Hermione Granger,I- I don't think I'm going. You go on without me.
543,20,Harry Potter,"Hermione, are you okay?"
544,20,Hermione Granger,Just go. You're wasting time!
545,20,Harry Potter,Come on.
546,21,Harry Potter,I think the Slytherin common room's this way.
547,21,Ron Weasley,Okay.
548,21,Percy Weasley,Excuse me.
549,21,Ron Weasley,"What are you doing… uh, I mean… What are you doing down here?"
550,21,Percy Weasley,"I happen to be a school prefect. You, on the other hand, have no business wandering the corridors at this time of night. What are your names again?"
551,21,Ron Weasley,Uhh…
552,21,Harry Potter,I'm…
553,21,Draco Malfoy,Crabbe! Goyle! Where have you two been? Pigging out in the Great Hall all this time? Why are you wearing glasses?
554,21,Harry Potter,Ah… Um… Reading.
555,21,Draco Malfoy,Reading?
556,21,Harry Potter,Uh huh.
557,21,Draco Malfoy,"I didn't know you could read. And what are you doing down here, Weasley?"
558,21,Percy Weasley,"Mind your attitude, Malfoy."
559,21,Draco Malfoy,"Well, sit down. You'd never know the Weasleys were pure-bloods, the way they behave. They're an embarrassment to the wizarding world. All of them. What's wrong with you, Crabbe?"
560,21,Ron Weasley,Ahem… Stomachache.
561,21,Draco Malfoy,"You know, I'm surprised that the Daily Prophet hasn't done a report on all these attacks. I suppose Dumbledore is trying to hush it all up. Father always said Dumbledore was the worst thing that ever happened to this place."
562,21,Harry Potter,You're wrong!
563,21,Draco Malfoy,What? You think there's someone here who's worse than Dumbledore? Well? Do you?
564,21,Harry Potter,Harry Potter?
565,21,Draco Malfoy,"Good one, Goyle. You're absolutely right. Saint Potter. And people actually think that he's the heir of Slytherin?!"
566,21,Harry Potter,But then you must have some idea who's behind it all.
567,21,Draco Malfoy,"You know I don't, Goyle. I told you yesterday. How many times do I have to tell you? Is this yours? But my father did say this. It's been fifty years since the Chamber was opened. He wouldn't tell me who opened it, only that they were expelled. The last time the Chamber of Secrets was opened, a Mudblood died. So, it's only a matter of time before one of them is killed this time. As for me, I hope it's Granger. What's the matter with you two? You're acting very... odd."
568,21,Harry Potter,It's his… stomachache. Calm down.
569,21,Ron Weasley,S-scar.
570,21,Harry Potter,Hair!
571,21,Draco Malfoy,Hey! Where are you going?
572,21,Ron Weasley,That was close!
573,21,Harry Potter,"Hermione, come out! We've got loads to tell you!"
574,21,Hermione Granger,Go away!
575,21,Moaning Myrtle,Ahh! Wait til you see. It's awful! Hehehehee!
576,21,Harry Potter,Hermione? Are you okay?
577,21,Moaning Myrtle,Ahhh!
578,21,Hermione Granger,Do you remember me telling you that the Polyjuice Potion was only for human transformations? It was cat's hair I plucked off Millicent Bulstrode's robes. Look at my face.
579,21,Moaning Myrtle,Heee haha!!
580,21,Ron Weasley,Look at your tail!
581,22,Ron Weasley,Have you spoken to Hermione?
582,22,Harry Potter,"She should be out of hospital in a few days, when she stops coughing up fur balls. What's this?"
583,22,Ron Weasley,Yuck!
584,22,Harry Potter,Looks like Moaning Myrtle's flooded the bathroom.
585,22,Moaning Myrtle,"Oooooh, oooh, ohhh, huh…huh. Come to throw something else at me?"
586,22,Harry Potter,Why would I throw something at you?
587,22,Moaning Myrtle,"Don't ask me! Here I am, minding my own business, and someone thinks it's funny to throw a book at me."
588,22,Ron Weasley,"But it can't hurt if someone throws something at you. I mean, it'll just go right through you."
589,22,Moaning Myrtle,Sure! Let's all throw books at Myrtle because she can't feel it! Ten points if you get it through her stomach! Fifty points if it goes through her head!
590,22,Harry Potter,"But, who threw it at you anyway?"
591,22,Moaning Myrtle,"I don't know. I didn't see them. I was just sitting in the Ubend thinking about death, aah, and it fell through the top of my head. Woooooooowhooo!"
592,22,Harry Potter,Tom Marvolo Riddle.
593,22,Harry Potter,My name is Harry Potter.
594,22,Harry Potter,Do you know anything about the Chamber of Secrets?
595,22,Harry Potter,Can you tell me?
596,23,Harry Potter,Excuse me. Could you tell me what's going on here? Are you Tom Riddle? Hello? Can you hear me?
597,23,Albus Dumbledore,Riddle! Come.
598,23,Voldemort,Professor Dumbledore.
599,23,Harry Potter,Dumbledore?
600,23,Albus Dumbledore,"It is not wise to be wandering around at this late hour, Tom."
601,23,Voldemort,"Yes, Professor. I-I suppose I had to see for myself if the rumours were true."
602,23,Albus Dumbledore,"I'm afraid they are, Tom. They are true."
603,23,Voldemort,"About the school, as well? I don't have a home to go to. They wouldn't really close Hogwarts, would they Professor?"
604,23,Albus Dumbledore,"I understand, Tom. But I'm afraid Headmaster Dippet may have no choice."
605,23,Voldemort,Sir- if it all stopped- if the person responsible was caught-
606,23,Albus Dumbledore,Is there something you wish to tell me?
607,23,Voldemort,"No, sir. Nothing."
608,23,Albus Dumbledore,"Very well, then. Off you go."
609,23,Voldemort,"Good night, sir."
610,23,Rubeus Hagrid,Let's get you out of there.
611,23,Voldemort,"Evening, Hagrid. I'm going to have to turn you in, Hagrid. I don't think you meant it to kill anyone, but-"
612,23,Rubeus Hagrid,You can't! You don't understand.
613,23,Voldemort,The dead girl's parents will be here tomorrow. The least Hogwarts can do is make sure the thing that killed their daughter is slaughtered.
614,23,Rubeus Hagrid,It wasn't him. Aragog never killed no one! Never!
615,23,Voldemort,"Monsters don't make good pets, Hagrid. Now, stand aside."
616,23,Rubeus Hagrid,No!
617,23,Voldemort,"Stand aside, Hagrid!"
618,23,Rubeus Hagrid,No!
619,23,Voldemort,Cistem aperio! Arania exumai!
620,23,Rubeus Hagrid,Aragog! Aragog!
621,23,Voldemort,"I can't let you go. They'll have your wand for this, Hagrid. You'll be expelled."
622,23,Harry Potter,Hagrid! Hagrid! Wow!
623,24,Harry Potter,It was Hagrid. Hagrid opened the Chamber of Secrets fifty years go.
624,24,Hermione Granger,It can't be Hagrid. It just can't be.
625,24,Ron Weasley,"We don't even know this Tom Riddle. He sounds like a dirty, rotten snitch to me."
626,24,Harry Potter,"The monster had killed somebody, Ron. What would any of us have done?"
627,24,Hermione Granger,"Look, Hagrid's our friend. Why don't we just go and ask him about it?"
628,24,Ron Weasley,"That'll be a cheerful visit! Hello Hagrid. Tell us, have you been setting anything mad and hairy loose in the castle lately?"
629,24,Rubeus Hagrid,"Mad and hairy? You wouldn't be talking about me now, would you?"
630,24,Harry Potter,No!
631,24,Ron Weasley,No!
632,24,Hermione Granger,No!
633,24,Harry Potter,"What's that you've got, Hagrid?"
634,24,Rubeus Hagrid,"Oh, it's Flesh Eating Slug Repellent. For the Mandrakes, you know. Now, according to Professor Sprout, they've still got a bit of growing up to do. But once their acne's cleared up, we'll be able to chop them up and stew them, and then we'll get those people down at the hospital un-petrified. In the meantime, though, you three had best be looking after yourselves. All right? Hmm. Hello, Neville!"
635,24,Neville Longbottom,"Harry, I don't know who did it, but you'd better come! Come on!"
636,24,Hermione Granger,"It had to be a Gryffindor. Nobody else knows our password, unless it wasn't a student."
637,24,Ron Weasley,"Whoever it was, they must have been looking for something."
638,24,Harry Potter,And they found it. Tom Riddle's diary is gone.
639,24,Oliver Wood,"Alright, listen up. We play our game, Hufflepuff doesn't stand a chance. We're stronger, quicker and smarter."
640,24,Fred Weasley,"And not to mention, they're dead scared that Harry will petrify them if they fly anywhere near him."
641,24,Oliver Wood,Well that too. Professor McGonagall.
642,24,Minerva McGonagall,This match has been cancelled.
643,24,Oliver Wood,We can't cancel Quidditch.
644,24,Minerva McGonagall,"Silence, Wood. You and your teammates will go to Gryffindor Tower, now. Potter, you and I will find Mr. Weasley. There's something the both of you have to see."
645,24,Minerva McGonagall,"I will warn you, this could be a wee bit of a shock."
646,24,Ron Weasley,Hermione!
647,24,Minerva McGonagall,"She was found near the library, along with this. Does it mean anything to either of you?"
648,24,Harry Potter,No.
649,24,Minerva McGonagall,"Could I have your attention, please? Because of recent events, these new rules will be put into effect immediately. All students will return to their house common rooms by six o'clock every evening. All students will be escorted to each lesson by a teacher. No exceptions. I should tell you this. Unless the culprit behind these attacks is caught, it is likely the school will be closed."
650,24,Harry Potter,"We've got to talk to Hagrid, Ron. I can't believe it's him, but if he did set the monster loose last time, he'll know how to get inside the Chamber of Secrets, and that's a start."
651,24,Ron Weasley,But you heard McGonagall! We're not allowed to leave the tower except for class.
652,24,Harry Potter,I think it's time to get my dad's old cloak out again.
653,25,Rubeus Hagrid,Who's there? Hello? Hello?
654,25,Harry Potter,What's that for?
655,25,Rubeus Hagrid,"Oh, nothing. I-I was expecting, ah… it doesn't matter. Come on in! I just made a pot of tea."
656,25,Harry Potter,"Hagrid, are you okay?"
657,25,Rubeus Hagrid,I'm fine! I'm alright.
658,25,Harry Potter,Did you hear about Hermione?
659,25,Rubeus Hagrid,"Oh yeah. I heard about that, all right."
660,25,Harry Potter,"Look, we have to ask you something. Do you know who's opened the Chamber of Secrets?"
661,25,Rubeus Hagrid,"What you have to understand about that is… Quick, under the cloak. Don't say a word. Be quiet, both of you. Professor Dumbledore, sir!"
662,25,Albus Dumbledore,"Good evening, Hagrid. I wonder, could we…?"
663,25,Rubeus Hagrid,Of course! Come in! Come in.
664,25,Ron Weasley,"That's Dad's boss! Cornelius Fudge, Minister of Magic!"
665,25,Cornelius Fudge,"Bad business, Hagrid. Very bad business. Had to come, three attacks on Muggle-borns. Things have gone far enough. The Ministry's got to act."
666,25,Rubeus Hagrid,"Oh, but I never… you know I never, Professor!"
667,25,Albus Dumbledore,"I want it understood, Cornelius, that Hagrid has my full confidence."
668,25,Cornelius Fudge,"Albus, look. Hagrid's record is against him. I've got to take him."
669,25,Rubeus Hagrid,Take me? Take me where? Not Azkaban Prison?
670,25,Cornelius Fudge,"I'm afraid we have no choice, Hagrid."
671,25,Lucius Malfoy,"Already here, Fudge? Good."
672,25,Rubeus Hagrid,What are you doing here? Get out of my house!
673,25,Lucius Malfoy,"Believe me, I take absolutely no pleasure being inside your… you call this a house? Huh. No, I simply called at the school, and was told the headmaster was here."
674,25,Albus Dumbledore,"Well, what exactly is it that you want with me?"
675,25,Lucius Malfoy,"The other governors and I have decided it's time for you to step aside. This is an order of suspension. You'll find all twelve signatures on it. I'm afraid we feel you've rather lost your touch. Well, what with all these attacks, there'll be no Muggle-borns left at Hogwarts. I can only imagine what an awful loss that would be to the school."
676,25,Rubeus Hagrid,"You can't take Professor Dumbledore away! Take him away, and the Muggle-borns won't stand a chance! You mark my words, there'll be killings next!"
677,25,Lucius Malfoy,You think so?
678,25,Albus Dumbledore,"Calm yourself, Hagrid. If the governors desire my removal, I will, of course, step aside. However, you will find that help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it."
679,25,Lucius Malfoy,Admirable sentiments. Shall we? Fudge!
680,25,Cornelius Fudge,"Come, Hagrid. Well?"
681,25,Rubeus Hagrid,"Ahem! If, uh, if anybody was looking for some stuff, then all they'd have to do would be to follow the spiders. Yup! That would lead them right! That's all I have to say. Oh, and someone will need to feed Fang while I'm away."
682,25,Cornelius Fudge,Good boy.
683,25,Ron Weasley,"Hagrid's right! With Dumbledore gone, there'll be an attack a day!"
684,25,Harry Potter,"Look! Well, come on. Come on, Fang!"
685,26,Harry Potter,Come on!
686,26,Ron Weasley,What?!
687,26,Harry Potter,You heard what Hagrid said. Follow the spiders.
688,26,Ron Weasley,They're headed to the Dark Forest! Why spiders?! Why couldn't it be follow the butterflies?!
689,26,Ron Weasley,"Harry, I don't like this… Harry, I don't like this at all!"
690,26,Harry Potter,Shush!
691,26,Ron Weasley,Can we go back now?
692,26,Harry Potter,Come on!
693,26,Aragog,Who is it?
694,26,Harry Potter,Don't panic.
695,26,Aragog,Hagrid? Is that you?
696,26,Harry Potter,We're friends of Hagrid's. And you? Y-y-you're Aragog aren't you?
697,26,Aragog,Yes. Hagrid has never sent men into our hollow before.
698,26,Harry Potter,"He's in trouble. Up at the school, there have been attacks. They think it's Hagrid. They think he opened the Chamber of Secrets, like before."
699,26,Aragog,That's a lie! Hagrid never opened the Chamber of Secrets.
700,26,Harry Potter,Then you're not the monster.
701,26,Aragog,"No! The monster was born in the castle. I came to Hagrid from a distant land, in the pocket of a traveller."
702,26,Ron Weasley,Harry.
703,26,Harry Potter,"Shush. But if you're not the monster, then- then what did kill that girl fifty years ago?"
704,26,Aragog,We do not speak of it. It is an ancient creature we spiders fear above all others.
705,26,Harry Potter,But have you seen it?
706,26,Aragog,"I never saw any part of the castle but the box in which Hagrid kept me. The girl was discovered in a bathroom. When I was accused, Hagrid brought me here."
707,26,Ron Weasley,Harry!
708,26,Harry Potter,What?
709,26,Ron Weasley,Ahh…
710,27,Harry Potter,"Well, thank you. We'll just… go."
711,27,Aragog,"Go? I think not. My sons and daughters do not harm Hagrid on my command. But I cannot deny them fresh meat when it wanders so willingly into our midst. Goodbye, friend of Hagrid."
712,27,Ron Weasley,Can we panic now? Know any spells?
713,27,Harry Potter,"One, but it's not powerful enough for all of them."
714,27,Ron Weasley,Where's Hermione when you need her?
715,27,Harry Potter,Let's go! Arania exumai! Go! Woah!
716,27,Ron Weasley,Woah!
717,27,Ron Weasley,Glad we're out of there! Ahhhhh!
718,27,Harry Potter,Arania exumai!
719,27,Ron Weasley,Thanks for that.
720,27,Harry Potter,Don't mention it. Get us out of here. Now! Come on! Come on! Move faster! Ahhh! Go on! Go! Get us in the air.
721,27,Ron Weasley,The flying gear's jammed!
722,27,Harry Potter,Come on! Pull!
723,27,Ron Weasley,"I'm trying! Follow the spiders! Follow the spiders! If Hagrid ever gets out of Azkaban, I'll kill him! I mean, what was the point of sending us in there? What have we found out?"
724,27,Harry Potter,We know one thing. Hagrid never opened the Chamber of Secrets. He was innocent.
725,28,Harry Potter,"Wish you were here Hermione. We need you… now, more than ever."
726,28,Ron Weasley,What's that?
727,28,Harry Potter,"Ron, this is why Hermione was in the library the day she was attacked. Come on!"
728,28,Harry Potter,"Of the many fearsome beasts that roam our land, none is more deadly than the basilisk. Capable of living for hundreds of years, instant death awaits any who meet this giant serpent's eye. Spiders flee before it. Ron, this is it! The monster in the Chamber of Secrets is a basilisk. That's why I can hear it speak. It's a snake!"
729,28,Ron Weasley,"But if it kills by looking people in the eye, why is no one dead?"
730,28,Harry Potter,"Because no one did look it in the eye. Not directly, at least. Colin saw it through his camera. Justin must have seen the basilisk through Nearly Headless Nick. Nick got the full blast of it, but he's a ghost, he can't die again. And Hermione… had the mirror. I bet you anything she was using it to look around corners, in case it came along."
731,28,Ron Weasley,"And Mrs. Norris? I'm pretty sure she didn't have a camera or a mirror, Harry."
732,28,Harry Potter,The water. There was water on the floor that night. She only saw the basilisk's reflection. Spiders flee before it. It all fits!
733,28,Ron Weasley,"But how's a basilisk been getting around? A dirty great snake, someone would have seen it."
734,28,Harry Potter,Hermione's answered that too.
735,28,Ron Weasley,Pipes? It's using the plumbing!
736,28,Harry Potter,"Remember what Aragog said, about that girl fifty years ago? She died in a bathroom? What if she never left?"
737,28,Ron Weasley,Moaning Myrtle.
738,28,Minerva McGonagall,"All students are to return to their house dormitories at once. All teachers to the second floor corridor, immediately."
739,28,Minerva McGonagall,"As you can see, the Heir of Slytherin has left another message. Our worst fear has been realised. A student has been taken by the monster into the Chamber itself. The students must be sent home. I'm afraid this is the end of Hogwarts."
740,28,Gilderoy Lockhart,"So sorry, dosed off, what have I missed?"
741,28,Severus Snape,"A girl has been snatched by the monster, Lockhart. Your moment has come, at last."
742,28,Gilderoy Lockhart,My m-moment?
743,28,Severus Snape,Weren't you saying just last night that you've known all along where the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets is?
744,28,Minerva McGonagall,"Well, that's settled. We'll leave you to deal with the monster, Gilderoy. Your skills, after all, are a legend."
745,28,Gilderoy Lockhart,"Very well, ah, I'll just be in my office getting, um, getting ready."
746,28,Poppy Pomfrey,"Who is it that the monster's taken, Minerva?"
747,28,Minerva McGonagall,Ginny Weasley.
748,28,Ron Weasley,Her skeleton will lie in the chamber forever. Ginny…
749,29,Harry Potter,"Lockhart may be useless, but he's going to try and get into the Chamber. At least we can tell him what we know."
750,29,Harry Potter,"Professor, we have some information for you! Are you going somewhere?"
751,29,Gilderoy Lockhart,"Uh, ah… well, yes… um, urgent call. Unavoidable. Got to go."
752,29,Ron Weasley,What about my sister?!
753,29,Gilderoy Lockhart,"Well, um, as to that, most unfortunate. No one regrets more than I."
754,29,Ron Weasley,You're the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher! You can't go now!
755,29,Gilderoy Lockhart,"Well, I must say, when I took the job there was nothing in the job description about a-"
756,29,Harry Potter,You're running away? After all that stuff you did in your books?
757,29,Gilderoy Lockhart,Books can be misleading!
758,29,Harry Potter,You wrote them!
759,29,Gilderoy Lockhart,"My dear boy, do use your common sense! My books wouldn't have sold half as well if people didn't think I'd done all those things!"
760,29,Harry Potter,You're a fraud! You've just been taking credit for what other wizards have done!
761,29,Ron Weasley,Is there anything you can do?
762,29,Gilderoy Lockhart,"Yes, now you mention it. I'm rather gifted with Memory Charms. Otherwise, you see, all those wizards would have gone blabbing. And I'd never have sold another book. In fact, ah… I'm ah… going to have to do the same to you."
763,29,Harry Potter,Don't even think about it.
764,29,Moaning Myrtle,"Oh! Who's there? Oh, hello Harry! Ron. What do you want?"
765,29,Harry Potter,To ask you how you died.
766,29,Moaning Myrtle,"Oh! It was dreadful. It happened right here in this very cubicle. I'd hidden because Olive Hornby was teasing me about my glasses. I was crying, and then I heard somebody come in."
767,29,Harry Potter,"Who was it, Myrtle?"
768,29,Moaning Myrtle,"I don't know! I was distraught! But they said something funny, a kind of made up language. And I realised it was a boy speaking, so I unlocked the door to tell him to go away and… I died."
769,29,Harry Potter,Just like that? How?
770,29,Moaning Myrtle,"I just remember seeing a pair of great big yellow eyes… over there, by that sink."
771,29,Harry Potter,"This is it. This is it, Ron. I think this is the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets."
772,29,Ron Weasley,"Say something, Harry! Say something in Parseltongue!"
773,29,Harry Potter,Hesha hassah.
774,29,Gilderoy Lockhart,"Excellent, Harry. Good work! Well then, I'll just be, ah… There's no need for me to stay."
775,29,Harry Potter,Oh yes there is! You first.
776,29,Gilderoy Lockhart,"Now boys, what good will it do?"
777,29,Ron Weasley,Better you than us.
778,29,Gilderoy Lockhart,"Um… but, obviously, yes. Sure you don't want to test it first? No! Ahhhhh! It's really quite filthy down here."
779,29,Harry Potter,All right. Let's go.
780,29,Moaning Myrtle,"Oh, Harry? If you die down there, you're welcome to share my toilet."
781,29,Harry Potter,"Uh… thanks, Myrtle. Ahhhh!"
782,29,Ron Weasley,Ahhhhh!
783,29,Ron Weasley,Ugh! 
784,29,Harry Potter,"Now remember, any sign of movement, close your eyes straightaway."
785,29,Ron Weasley,Go on.
786,30,Harry Potter,This way.
787,30,Ron Weasley,What's this?
788,30,Gilderoy Lockhart,It looks like a… snake.
789,30,Harry Potter,It's a snakeskin.
790,30,Ron Weasley,"Bloody hell. Whatever shed this must be sixty feet long, or more! Heart of a lion, this one."
791,30,Gilderoy Lockhart,"The adventure ends here, boys. But don't fret. The world will know our story. How I was too late to save the girl. How you two tragically lost your minds at the sight of her mangled body. So, you first, Mr. Potter. Say goodbye to your memories. Obliviate!"
792,30,Ron Weasley,Harry! Harry!
793,30,Harry Potter,"Ron! Ron, are you okay?"
794,30,Ron Weasley,I'm fine!
795,30,Gilderoy Lockhart,Uhh… hello. Who are you?
796,30,Ron Weasley,Um… Ron Weasley.
797,30,Gilderoy Lockhart,"Really? And uh, who-who am I?"
798,30,Ron Weasley,Lockhart's memory charm backfired! He hasn't got a clue who he is!
799,30,Gilderoy Lockhart,"It's an odd sort of place this, isn't it? Do you live here?"
800,30,Ron Weasley,No.
801,30,Gilderoy Lockhart,Really? Well?
802,30,Ron Weasley,What do I do now?
803,30,Harry Potter,You wait here and try and shift some of this rock so we can get back through! I'll go on and find Ginny!
804,30,Ron Weasley,Okay!
805,30,Harry Potter,Hesha hassah.
806,31,Harry Potter,"Ginny… Ginny! Oh, Ginny, please don't be dead. Wake up. Wake up! Please, wake up!"
807,31,Voldemort,She won't wake.
808,31,Harry Potter,"Tom. Tom Riddle! What do you mean, she won't wake? She's not…?"
809,31,Voldemort,"She's still alive, but only just."
810,31,Harry Potter,Are you a ghost?
811,31,Voldemort,"A memory, preserved in a diary for fifty years."
812,31,Harry Potter,"She's cold as ice. Ginny, please don't be dead. Wake up! You've got to help me, Tom. There's a basilisk."
813,31,Voldemort,It won't come until it's called.
814,31,Harry Potter,"Give me my wand, Tom."
815,31,Voldemort,You won't be needing it.
816,31,Harry Potter,"Listen, we've got to go! We've got to save her!"
817,31,Voldemort,"I'm afraid I can't do that, Harry. You see, as poor Ginny grows weaker, I grow stronger. Yes Harry, it was Ginny Weasley who opened the Chamber of Secrets."
818,31,Harry Potter,No. She couldn't. She wouldn't!
819,31,Voldemort,"It was Ginny who set the basilisk on the Mudbloods and Filch's cat, Ginny who wrote the threatening messages on the walls."
820,31,Harry Potter,But why?
821,31,Voldemort,"Because I told her to. You'll find that I can be very persuasive. Not that she knew what she was doing. She was, shall we say, in a kind of trance. Still, the power of the diary began to scare her. And she tried to dispose of it in the girl's bathroom. And then, who should find it, but you? The very person I was most anxious to meet."
822,31,Harry Potter,"But, why did you want to meet me?"
823,31,Voldemort,"I knew I had to talk to you, meet you if I could. So I decided to show you my capture of that brainless oaf, Hagrid, to gain your trust."
824,31,Harry Potter,"Hagrid's my friend! And you framed him, didn't you?"
825,31,Voldemort,It was my word against Hagrid's. Only Dumbledore seemed to think he was innocent.
826,31,Harry Potter,I'll bet Dumbledore saw right through you.
827,31,Voldemort,"He certainly kept an annoyingly close watch on me after that. I knew it wouldn't be safe to open the Chamber again while I was still at school, so I decided to leave behind a diary preserving my sixteen-year-old self in its pages, so that one day I would be able to lead another to finish Salazar Slytherin's noble work."
828,31,Harry Potter,"Well, you haven't finished it this time. In a few hours, the Mandrake Draught will be ready, and everyone who was petrified will be all right again."
829,31,Voldemort,"Haven't I told you? Killing Mudbloods doesn't matter to me anymore. For many months now, my new target… has been you. How is it that a baby, with no extraordinary magical talent, was able to defeat the greatest wizard of all time? How did you escape with nothing but a scar, while Lord Voldemort's powers were destroyed?"
830,31,Harry Potter,Why do you care how I escaped? Voldemort was after your time.
831,31,Voldemort,"Voldemort is my past, present, and future."
832,31,Harry Potter,You! You're the Heir of Slytherin. You're Voldemort.
833,31,Voldemort,"Surely, you didn't think I was going to keep my filthy Muggle father's name? No. I fashioned a new name, a name I knew wizards everywhere would one day fear to speak, when I became the greatest sorcerer in the world."
834,31,Harry Potter,Albus Dumbledore is the greatest sorcerer in the world!
835,31,Voldemort,Dumbledore's been driven out of this castle by the mere memory of me!
836,31,Harry Potter,He'll never be gone! Not as long as those who remain are loyal to him! Fawkes?
837,31,Voldemort,"So, this is what Dumbledore sends his great defender. A songbird and an old hat. Shearhas samnathas selithaine."
838,32,Voldemort,"Let's match the power of Lord Voldemort, Heir of Salazar Slytherin, against the famous Harry Potter. Sethae- This. Parseltongue won't save you now, Potter! It only obeys me!"
839,32,Voldemort,"No! Your bird may have blinded the basilisk, but it can still hear you!"
840,32,Voldemort,"Yes, Potter, the process is nearly complete. In a few minutes Ginny will be dead, and I will cease to be a memory. Lord Voldemort will return, very… much… alive!"
841,32,Harry Potter,Ginny.
842,33,Voldemort,"Remarkable, isn't it, how quickly the venom of the basilisk penetrates the body? I'd guess you have little more than a minute to live. You'll be with your dear Mudblood mother soon, Harry. Funny, the damage a silly little book can do, especially in the hands of a silly, little girl. What are you doing? Stop! No! Ahhhhh! Ahhhhhh!"
843,33,Harry Potter,Ginny.
844,33,Ginny Weasley,"Harry. It was me, but I swear, I didn't mean to! Riddle made me, and… Harry, you're hurt!"
845,33,Harry Potter,"Don't worry. Ginny, you need to get yourself out. Follow the Chamber, and you'll find Ron. You were brilliant, Fawkes. I just wasn't quick enough… Of course! Phoenix tears have healing powers. Thanks! It's alright, Ginny. It's over. It's just a memory."
846,33,Gilderoy Lockhart,Amazing! This is just like magic!
847,34,Albus Dumbledore,"You both realise, of course, that in the past few hours you have broken perhaps a dozen school rules?"
848,34,Harry Potter,"Yes, sir."
849,34,Ron Weasley,"Yes, sir."
850,34,Albus Dumbledore,And there is sufficient evidence to have you both expelled.
851,34,Harry Potter,"Yes, sir."
852,34,Ron Weasley,"Yes, sir."
853,34,Albus Dumbledore,"Therefore, it is only fitting that you both receive Special Awards for Services to the school."
854,34,Ron Weasley,"Thanks, sir!"
855,34,Albus Dumbledore,"And now, Mr. Weasley, if you would, have an owl deliver these release papers to Azkaban? I believe we- we want our gamekeeper back. Harry… first, I want to thank you, Harry. You must have shown me real loyalty down in the Chamber. Nothing but that could have called Fawkes to you. And, um... second, I sense something is troubling you. Am I right, Harry?"
856,34,Harry Potter,"It's just… You see, sir, I- I couldn't help but notice certain things, certain- certain similarities between Tom Riddle and me."
857,34,Albus Dumbledore,"I see. Well, you can speak Parseltongue, Harry. Why? Because Lord Voldemort can speak Parseltongue. If I'm not mistaken, Harry, he transferred some of his powers to you the night he gave you that scar."
858,34,Harry Potter,Voldemort transferred some of his powers… to me?
859,34,Albus Dumbledore,"Not intentionally, but yes."
860,34,Harry Potter,So the Sorting Hat was right! I should be in Slytherin.
861,34,Albus Dumbledore,"It's true, Harry. You possess many of the qualities that Voldemort himself prizes. Determination, resourcefulness, and if I may say so, a certain disregard for the rules. Why then, did the Sorting Hat place you in Gryffindor?"
862,34,Harry Potter,Because I asked it to.
863,34,Albus Dumbledore,"Exactly, Harry! Exactly! Which makes you different from Voldemort. It is not our abilities that show what we truly are. It is our choices. If you want proof why you belong in Gryffindor, then I suggest that you look more closely at this. Be careful."
864,34,Harry Potter,Godric Gryffindor.
865,34,Albus Dumbledore,"Ah, it would take a true Gryffindor to pull that out of the hat."
866,35,Harry Potter,Dobby! So this is your master! The family you serve is the Malfoys.
867,35,Dobby,Um…Hummmm.
868,35,Lucius Malfoy,"I'll deal with you later. Out of my way, Potter! So, it's true, you have returned!"
869,35,Albus Dumbledore,"When the governors learned that Arthur Weasley's daughter was taken into the Chamber, they saw fit to summon me back."
870,35,Lucius Malfoy,Ridiculous!
871,35,Albus Dumbledore,"Curiously, Lucius, several of them were under the impression that you would curse their families, if they did not agree to suspend me in the first place."
872,35,Lucius Malfoy,How dare you?!
873,35,Albus Dumbledore,I beg your pardon?
874,35,Lucius Malfoy,"My sole concern has always been, and will always be, the welfare of this school and, of course, its students. The culprit has been identified, I presume?"
875,35,Albus Dumbledore,"Oh, yes."
876,35,Lucius Malfoy,And? Who was it?
877,35,Albus Dumbledore,Voldemort.
878,35,Lucius Malfoy,Ah!
879,35,Albus Dumbledore,"Only, this time, he chose to act through somebody else, by means of this."
880,35,Lucius Malfoy,I see.
881,35,Albus Dumbledore,"Fortunately, our young Mr. Potter discovered it. One hopes that no more of Lord Voldemort's old school things should find their way into innocent hands. The consequences for the one responsible would be severe."
882,35,Lucius Malfoy,"Well, let us hope that Mr. Potter will always be around to save the day."
883,35,Harry Potter,Don't worry. I will be.
884,35,Lucius Malfoy,"Dumbledore. Come, Dobby. We're leaving."
885,35,Dobby,Ahh! Oww!
886,35,Harry Potter,"Sir, I wonder if I could have that? Mr. Malfoy! Mr. Malfoy! I have something of yours."
887,35,Lucius Malfoy,Mine? I don't know what you're talking about.
888,35,Harry Potter,"Oh I think you do, sir. I think you slipped the diary into Ginny Weasley's cauldron, that day at Diagon Alley."
889,35,Lucius Malfoy,"You do, do you? Why don't you prove it? Come, Dobby. Dobby!"
890,35,Harry Potter,Open it.
891,35,Lucius Malfoy,Dobby?
892,35,Dobby,Master has given Dobby a sock!
893,35,Lucius Malfoy,What? I didn't give…
894,35,Dobby,Master has presented Dobby with clothes! Dobby is free!
895,35,Lucius Malfoy,You've lost me my servant!
896,35,Dobby,You shall not harm Harry Potter!
897,35,Lucius Malfoy,Avada…
898,35,Lucius Malfoy,"Your parents were meddlesome fools, too. You mark my words, Potter, one day soon you are going to meet the same sticky end!"
899,35,Dobby,Harry Potter freed Dobby! How can Dobby ever repay him?
900,35,Harry Potter,Just promise me something.
901,35,Dobby,"Anything, sir!"
902,35,Harry Potter,Never try to save me life again.
903,36,Other,"Welcome back, Sir Nicholas!"
904,36,Nearly Headless Nick,Thank you!
905,36,Other,"Good evening, Sir Nicholas!"
906,36,Nearly Headless Nick,Good evening!
907,36,Other,"Good to see you, Sir Nicholas!"
908,36,Nearly Headless Nick,Thank you! Hello! Hermione! Welcome back!
909,36,Hermione Granger,"Thanks, Sir Nicholas!"
910,36,Neville Longbottom,Harry… It's Hermione!
911,36,Ron Weasley,"Uhh… umm… Wel- Welcome back, Hermione."
912,36,Hermione Granger,It's good to be back! Congratulations! I can't believe you solved it!
913,36,Harry Potter,"Well, we had loads of help from you. We couldn't have done it without you."
914,36,Hermione Granger,Thanks.
915,36,Minerva McGonagall,"Could I have your attention, please?"
916,36,Albus Dumbledore,"Before we begin the feast, let us have a round of applause for Professor Sprout and Madame Pomfrey, whose Mandrake juice has been so successfully administered to all who had been petrified. Also, in light of the recent events, as a school treat, all exams have been cancelled!"
917,36,Hermione Granger,Oh no!
918,36,Rubeus Hagrid,"Sorry I'm late! The owl that delivered my release papers got all lost and confused. Some ruddy bird called Errol. And I'd just like to say that if it hadn't been for you, Harry, and Ron, and Hermione, of course, I would uh - I'd still be you-know-where, so I- I'd just like to say... thanks."
919,36,Harry Potter,"Well there's no Hogwarts without you, Hagrid."
920,36,Rubeus Hagrid,Oh!
