# CSS_project
This is a repository for our final assignment in the course Computation Social Science in the spring of 2023.

The data for this project was collected from the [Harry Potter wiki pages and API](#https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page)

We have created a [website](#insert-link-to-website) to present our findings. The website showcases a complex, fun and interactive analysis (and visualizations) of our findings within the Harry Potter community. The website was created using [this template](#https://github.com/lalessan/project-website-template).

The explainer notebook ["Explainer_Notebook.ipynb"](#Explainer_Notebook.ipynb) contains all the behind the scenes stuff, details on the dataset, why weâ€™ve selected this particular dataset, explanations of our choices regarding network analysis, etc.
